Walls
=================================

Requirments
-----------
Before installing this plugin, a few things are required.
 - [WorldEdit](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/worldedit/)
 - MySQL Database (**optional**) - If you wish to use stats, you must have an SQL database.

Conflicts
---------
 - Any plugin that modifies damage amounts by applying more damage can sometimes cause issues and make the player actually die (ie McMMO).
 - Some locking plugins such as LWC have been reported to have issues with the lobby signs, but should work normally if protection is turned of for those signs.
 - WORLD PORTAL will make this plugin completely break if the lobby is not in a world that is loaded at start!
